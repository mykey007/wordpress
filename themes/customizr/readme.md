# Notes for developers
## Customizr loop 
For the development of this theme, I created only one loop for all kind of content. It is located in index.php.
I also made the choice to use template parts instead of using the template hierarchy.
1. The loop calls the main template : article-content.php
2. The templates parts are then called in article-content.php, depending on the post type or context.

## Translation
The themes is ready for translation and already translated in french. Translation files are in /lang.
